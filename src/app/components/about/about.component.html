    LoRa Boise Area Sensors
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
      LoRa allows for a network of Low Power and Long Range devices. LoRa and the concept 
      of the Internet of Things allows people to build smart networks of devices that gather a variety of 
      data. Data is transfered securely to a database and can then be displayed for clients to see. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      
      An unlimited number of nodes may be deployed to create a mesh of sensors. The nodes need to be within 
      10 km of a collector. Once in the field though, nodes may be powered by a simple battery and solar charger.
      Sensors can even be made to track battery voltage to check when one is not charging as well.

      This project is network for the Boise Area. We will be gathering weather data for the surrounding area.
